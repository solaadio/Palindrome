Notes
There are 4 projects in the solution.
1) A library project (the business logic)
2) A Unit-Test project
3) A WPF frontend that consumes the library
4) A console project that consumes the library

No 3rd-party libaries were used in the solution but there is a Nuget download of the unit test APIs
